# Robotics Vision Systems

Vision systems are crucial for autonomous robots to perceive and interact with their environment.

## Key Components

- Camera sensors (RGB, depth, thermal)
- Image processing algorithms
- Object detection and recognition
- SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)

## Recent Advances

Recent developments in deep learning have significantly improved robot vision capabilities, particularly in real-time object detection and scene understanding.
