# Project Ideas

A collection of potential projects to work on.

## Personal Knowledge Base

Build a local RAG system that can answer questions about my notes. This would combine:
- Markdown note storage
- Vector embeddings for semantic search
- Local LLM for question answering

## Smart Home Automation

Create a privacy-focused smart home system that runs entirely locally without cloud dependencies.

## Reading List Manager

An app to track books, papers, and articles I want to read, with AI-powered summarization and note-taking features.
